# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to create a dataframe that summarizes ride sharing data between rural, suburban and urban cities. By breaking down the data, we can create a line graph visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
After completing our analysis of the data, we can see many facts such as:

- Rural cities have the least amount of drivers, whereas urban cities have the most
- Rural cities have the least amount of rides and fares, urban cities again have the most for both
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver, despite having the least amount in total
- Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver, despite having the most amount in total

## Summary
Based on the analysis of the data given, we have been able to examine the trends of fares and money spent in different city types. By splitting the chart into weekly totals, we can gain insight on how PyBer will perform on a weekly basis. Overall, it is fair to say that rural cities charge more per ride based on their lowery supply of drivers whereas, urban cities charge the least due to a great amount of drivers.
